            Hi! I am Bryan. I am a librarian at Nashville Public Library and a member of Library Freedom Project. Not only in libraries, but in society, we are a crossroads about privacy rights. I want to talk about our current responsibilities, and some ways to think about the paths ahead. All the little green "i"s you see through this presentation are you. You're a person, you count. What you want your future to be? What do you want your society to be like?
                Interactive exercise:
							- Are you a privacy vegan or a privacy nihilist?

						Facebook is always watching you. Even when you are not on Facebook. Non-PII data from coookies  can be reverse engineered via the mosaic effect. Academic studies have shown this for years. If this wasn't the case, Facebook would have no reason to track you when you don't use their site. The Yale Privacy Lab found that many popular apps on Android, like Weather Channel, Lyft, and Tinder (to name a few) are loaded with third-party trackers. Privacy International found that 61% of apps they tested sent data to Facebook whether you had a Facebook account or not. We know this because Android is open source. If these researchers found the same results with iOS it would illegal to share it because of the DMCA.

						      Phones are fundamentally insecure. If you are using a phone your phone company knows your general location at all times. And we know now the sell this info. The text function in your phone is unencrypted unless you use a special app. We know on Android many apps collect data even without you knowing. Apple isn't open source so it is harder to study. A lot of apps have remote microphone access. The phone knows when you sleep, when you poop, who your friends are, who you work with, that what you think about, what music and tv shows you like, what porn you like, what church you feel guilty about not going to, and if you wear a fitness tracker it knows when you dream, it knows a lot more. No one has more info about you than your phone. Not your doctor, not your mom, not your spouse. Well, maybe Google if your phone was made by Google. DMCA makes it illegal for you to root your phone. You are only allowed to root your phone and change its software because of a special exception to DMCA determined by Librarian of Congress as recommended by the Register of Copyrights.
