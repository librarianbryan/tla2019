					<aside class="notes">Hi! I am Bryan. I am a librarian at Nashville Public Library and member of Library Freedom Project. Not only in libraries, but in society, we are a crossroads about privacy rights. I want to talk about our current responsibilities, and some ways to think about the paths ahead. All the little green "i"s you see through this presentation are you. You're a person, you count. What you want your future to be? What are your rights? What are your responsibilities?

This is the desktop app. If we consider the same data collection on via phone app, it also knows where you are at the times, when you sleep, if your moving fast and slow, etc. Your phone is literally an extention of yourself and we are all, no joke, cyborgs.

						Facebook is always watching you. Even when you are not on Facebook. Non-PII data from coookies  can be reverse engineered via the mosaic effect. Academic studies have shown this for years. If this wasn't the case, Facebook would have no reason to track you when you don't use their site. The Yale Privacy Lab found that many popular apps on Android, like Weather Channel, Lyft, and Tinder (to name a few) are loaded with third-party trackers. Privacy International found that 61% of apps they tested sent data to Facebook whether you had a Facebook account or not. We know this because Android is open source. It would be illegal to do this kind of study on iOS because of DRM.

						Phones are fundamentally insecure. If you are using a phone your phone company knows your general location at all times. And we know now the sell this info. The text function in your phone is unencrypted unless you use a special app. We know on Android many apps collect data even without you knowing. Apple isn't open source but it is harder to study. A lot of apps have remote microphone access. The phone knows when you sleep, when you poop, who your friends are, who you work with, that what you think about, what music and tv shows you like, what porn you like, what church you feel guilty about not going to, and if you wear a fitness tracker, it knows a lot more.
